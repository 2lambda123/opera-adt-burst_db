# Burst_DB
Sentinel-1 Burst Coverage Database for OPERA SAS

üö® This toolbox is still in pre-alpha stage and undergoing rapid development. üö®

## How to install
Follow the steps below to install `burst_db` using conda environment.

1. Download source code:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/opera-adt/burst_db burst_db
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
conda install -c conda-forge --file burst_db/requirements.txt
```

3. Install `burst_db` via pip:

```bash
# run "pip install -e" to install in development mode
python -m pip install ./burst_db
```

## How to use
`build_database.py` provides CLI to provide the input / output files and settings for the bounding box calculation. Below is the usage of the program.

>build_database.py [-h] [-mxy MXY MXY] [-sxy SXY SXY] [-d DEPLOYABLE] sqlite_path_in sqlite_path_out

- `-mxy` : x / y margin to apply to the bounding box. Default: [5000.0 5000.0]
- `-sxy` : x / y snap value to ceil/floor the boundaries' coordinates. Default: [30 30]
- `-d` : (Optional) Smaller version of the DB will be saved to the path `DEPLOYABLE`
- `sqlite_path_in` : Path to the source SQLite database file for Sentinel-1 burst map released by ESA. The data can be downloaded from [here](https://sar-mpc.eu/files/S1_burstid_20220530.zip).
- `sqlite_path_out` : Path to the output SQLite database file.



## Usage

To create a database of the Sentinel-1 burst footprints, use the `make_db.py` script. 
This script will download ESA's burst map (available here: https://sar-mpc.eu/files/S1_burstid_20220530.zip) and augment it with a unique ID per burst, as well as the bounding box limits in UTM. 


```console
$ python make_db.py --output-path burst_map.sqlite3

ESA database not found, downloading...
Downloading ESA burst database
...
```

If you already have the ESA database, you can use the `--esa-db` option to specify the path to the database. 
Otherwise, `wget` is used in the script to download the files.


The full set of options are available through the `--help` flag:

```console
$ python make_db.py --help
usage: make_db.py [-h] [--esa-db-path ESA_DB_PATH] [--output-path OUTPUT_PATH] [--snap SNAP] [--margin MARGIN] [--limit LIMIT] [--max-procs MAX_PROCS]

options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --esa-db-path ESA_DB_PATH
                        Path to the ESA sqlite burst database to convert, downloaded from https://sar-mpc.eu/files/S1_burstid_20220530.zip . Will be downloaded if not exists. (default: burst_map_IW_000001_375887.sqlite3)
  --output-path OUTPUT_PATH
                        Path to the output database (default: burst_map_IW_000001_375887.OPERA-JPL.20221109_200032.sqlite3)
  --snap SNAP           Snap the bounding box to the nearest multiple of this value. (default: 50.0)
  --margin MARGIN       Add this margin surrounding the bounding box of bursts. (default: 4000.0)
  --limit LIMIT         For testing, limit the number of rows to process (default: None)
  --max-procs MAX_PROCS
                        Max CPU count to use for processing geometries (default: None)
```

## Setup

```console
# Download the code
git clone git@github.com:opera-adt/burst_db.git
# Install the requirements
conda create -n my-burst-env --file requirements.txt
conda activate my-burst-env

python make_db.py --help
